"""Install supported upstream models: a target repository and the draft
trained for its architecture, as an assembly (assembly.py).

The Hub owns downloads and snapshots; this module inspects the target,
selects its components and decides when to follow the Hub, and the native
source adapters own tensor validation and preparation. A target is
identified by its own metadata (a GGUF header or an MLX config), read before
any weight download, and paired with the draft trained for its family
(families.py); repository names play no part. Every start follows the
target's revision, then its draft's, with one Hub request each, and
publishes a new commit's assembly atomically; the installed assembly starts
when the Hub cannot answer or the new commit cannot be installed.
