# Development

Use Apple Silicon with macOS 26.4+, Xcode 26 or newer, Python 3.12–3.14,
and a Metal 4 compiler with `uint4b_format` tensor support.
The macOS 26.2 SDK can compile the host code, but Xcode 26.2's default Metal
component cannot compile the kernels; select a newer Metal toolchain when
using that SDK. Packaged users need none of these development tools.

## Build and run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/incoai/splash.git
cd splash
make -j4
./splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
```

`--model` names an upstream Hugging Face model: an MLX affine 4-bit, group-64
repository such as `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`, or a GGUF repository and
variant, `OWNER/REPO:VARIANT`, such as `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M`.
Splash identifies the model from its own metadata and pairs the DFlash2 draft
trained for it. The first serve sets up Python dependencies, downloads the
model and its draft, and prepares the weights once
([Weight preparation](#weight-preparation)); each start follows the model's
revision ([Revisions](#revisions)). `--model-dir DIRECTORY` serves a target
already on disk instead, an MLX affine 4-bit, group-64 directory or a
directory holding one GGUF, with the matching DFlash2 draft named by
`--draft-model` ([Local model directories](#local-model-directories)).
Legacy Splash packages remain loadable
([Legacy Splash packages](#legacy-splash-packages)). Public repositories need
no login; private or gated ones need `HF_TOKEN` or `hf auth login`. Ctrl+C
stops serving, and a second Ctrl+C stops the engine at once; stop before
upgrading.

An engine that fails is restarted at once, and failed restarts back off from
1 to 16 seconds. Meanwhile generation requests get 503 `engine_recovering`,
whose message names the last failure.

Use `--max-context 100K` or `--max-memory 28G` to set optional limits. Memory
limits cap Metal allocations, not combined process RSS. Agents must already be
installed; `./splash claude|opencode|codex|hermes|pi` connects to the running server.
Arguments pass through, for example `./splash codex resume --last`.

Set `SPLASH_API_KEY` in the server and agent shells to require authentication;
`serve --api-key KEY` overrides the server's environment value. API requests
then require `Authorization: Bearer KEY` (or Anthropic's `x-api-key`). Health
and readiness probes and the chat page remain public; enter the key in the
chat page to send requests. The page does not persist the key. Use
`serve --no-webui` to disable the page. Authentication is off by default.

HTTP request bodies are limited to 128 MiB; `serve --max-request-size 256M`
overrides this. Concurrent input bytes share a budget of at least 512 MiB
(or twice the request limit), including retained generation inputs. This is
an input-byte budget, not a process RSS limit: large ASCII/base64 strings can
use roughly twice their encoded size during JSON parsing alone. Decoded images
and object-heavy JSON need additional memory. Oversized requests return 413;
exhausted ingress capacity returns 503. Image and model context limits apply
independently.
Stored Responses history is charged before decoding. Uploads allow 30 seconds
of inactivity; total upload time is limited to 30 seconds plus the body size
at 512 KiB/s (286 seconds for 128 MiB), capped by the overall request deadline.
Timed-out uploads return 408 and release their input reservation.
`/status` reports `http.request_body_bytes` and `http.max_request_bytes`.

Source `install/completions/splash.bash` for Bash or
`install/completions/_splash` for Zsh after `compinit`. Completion suggests
commands, the official model IDs (bundled, and as `splash serve` last refreshed
them), the upstream models the README starts with and installed models, a
GGUF's `OWNER/REPO:VARIANT` included, without network access.

## Server configuration

The default listener is `127.0.0.1:8000`. To accept LAN connections:

```sh
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

Connect to the server's LAN IP. `--host` selects the IPv4 bind address;
`--allowed-host NAME` accepts an additional HTTP Host name, such as the Mac's
`.local` name, a custom DNS name or a proxy hostname. It does not change the
listener or allowlist client IPs. A request that names the server any other way
gets 403 with the `--allowed-host` flag that would accept it; the check keeps out
web pages that rebind a DNS name to this address. The chat page works over plain
HTTP from another machine too.

Use `--port 8001` or set `SPLASH_PORT=8001` to select another port. Set the same
`SPLASH_PORT` in the local agent shell. Separate ports allow separate servers;
their memory limits are independent. The packaged agent launchers connect to
loopback, so use a listener that includes loopback when launching agents locally.

### Server options

`splash serve --help` lists all options and examples. Common options:

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--revision` | Default branch | Select an upstream target branch, tag, or commit. See [revisions](#revisions). |
| `--model-dir` | None | Serve a local directory: a Splash package (no draft) or an MLX/GGUF target with `--draft-model`. See [local model directories](#local-model-directories). |
| `--draft-model` | Matching DFlash2 checkpoint | Override the draft with a compatible repository or local directory. See [drafts](#drafts). |
| `--language-only` | Off | Skip vision loading; image and PDF input is rejected. See [vision](#vision). |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address. |
| `--port` | `SPLASH_PORT` or `8000` | HTTP port. |
| `--max-memory` | Auto | Ceiling on Metal allocations, e.g. `28G`; not combined process RSS. |
| `--max-context` | Auto | Context limit, up to `256K`, e.g. `100K`. |
| `--max-cache-disk` | `0` (off) | Session-local SSD cache, e.g. `16G`. See [disk cache](#disk-cache). |
| `--kv-format` | `int8` | Target KV storage: `int8` or `bf16`. |
| `--max-image-pixels` | `4194304` | Maximum resized pixels per image. |
| `--allowed-host` | No extra names | Additional HTTP Host name, e.g. `mymac.local`; repeatable. |
| `--api-key` | `SPLASH_API_KEY` or none | Require a bearer token or `x-api-key`. |
| `--no-webui` | Off | Disable the chat page. |

The startup summary and `maximum_context_tokens` in `/status` show the effective
context limit. `/v1/models` and `/v1/models/{id}` report the same limit as
`max_model_len` and its compatibility alias `context_length`, including model
aliases. Clients can impose a smaller limit. With enough memory, request the
full native window with `--max-context 256K`. This is a capacity limit, not a
guarantee of a fast first token for a long uncached prompt. If the model
cannot fit, startup prints a memory budget breakdown and stops.

`splash pi` adds a `splash` provider to Pi's `models.json` (`splash-<port>` for
a server on another port), preserving other providers, settings and sessions.
The browser chat and agent launchers connect to the running server; a model
need not appear in a client's catalog to serve it by its full repository ID.

### KV cache precision

Select the target KV format when starting the server:

```bash
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --kv-format bf16
```

BF16 avoids target KV quantization, uses approximately twice the target KV
memory, and can be slower at long contexts. Model weights are unchanged.
Restart to switch formats. Omit `--kv-format` or use `--kv-format int8` for the
default. The [SSD cache](#disk-cache) supports both formats, preserving their
stored bytes without further quantization; it does not survive a restart.

## API model aliases

Repeat `--served-model-name NAME` to accept additional API model IDs. The full
`--model` ID still selects the model. `/v1/models` lists that ID first, followed
by unique aliases; each alias's `root` identifies the loaded model. Generation
and scoring responses always report the real model ID, even when requested
through an alias. The model list and lookup support both names.

```sh
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --served-model-name local-qwen
```

Aliases cannot contain whitespace, control characters, `\`, `%`, `?`, `#`,
or empty, `.` or `..` path segments. This keeps model discovery URLs unambiguous.

## Default reasoning effort

`--default-reasoning-effort` (or `SPLASH_DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT`) sets the
fallback for Chat `reasoning_effort` and Responses `reasoning.effort` when absent
or null. Accepted values: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`,
`max`. An explicit request value wins; the CLI flag takes precedence over the
environment. Unset, the model's template default is unchanged. Effort names are
passed to the template using the same mapping as per-request values, not token
budgets.

```sh
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --default-reasoning-effort none
```

`/apply-template` uses the same default. Anthropic `thinking` keeps its protocol
semantics (off when omitted); judgment endpoints always disable thinking.

## Upstream model loading

`install/upstream.py` installs a model from its upstream repository: it
inspects the target, pairs the draft trained for it and decides when to follow
the Hub. The result is an assembly, a local directory of links to the sources'
Hub snapshots, published atomically. The other installer modules each own one
part: `hub.py` the sources, the Hub cache and its pins; `assembly.py` the
assembly layout, its build, verification and garbage collection, and the
metadata derived from a GGUF; `families.py` the registry; `legacy.py` Splash
packages; and `models.py` model IDs, selections, the installation lock and the
command line (`install/models.py --model ID prepare|verify|link`, where `link`
prints the selection link). The assembly's
`model.json` records the resolved sources and selected formats. The native
loader reads it, and `splash serve`, `test-http-real` and the HTTP regression
benchmark hold it while they run, so a concurrent installation cannot collect
the assembly they serve. It is local installation metadata, not a file model
publishers supply.

A target is identified by its own metadata: an MLX config's `text_config`, or
the one `gguf.model_config` derives from the selected GGUF's header, read with a
few HTTP range requests before any weight download. The registry
(`families.FAMILIES`) states each supported architecture's signature and the
draft trained for it; repository names and model-card `base_model` fields play
no part. An MLX target must declare affine 4-bit, group-64 `quantization` in
`config.json`. Native source adapters validate model geometry, quantization,
tensor shapes and draft compatibility again before execution. Remote Python
code is not loaded.

```bash
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit
splash serve --model unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --language-only
```

A model ID with `--revision`, `--language-only` or `--draft-model` is a
separate installation from the same ID without them.

### Revisions

Installation resolves each source's revision to a commit once, downloads by
that commit and records it in `model.json`, so a repository update cannot mix
files from different revisions. It pins those snapshots in the Hub cache
(`refs/splash/<installation>/<commit>`), so pruning the cache cannot remove files
an installed model links. Publishing a new assembly retires the installation's
other pins, in the repositories it links and in those its predecessor linked,
so pruning can free what no installation links any more.

Every start resolves the target's revision (the default branch, or
`--revision`) with one Hub request of at most 5 seconds (`hub.HUB_TIMEOUT`),
and when the Hub answered, the default branch of the draft's repository
([Drafts](#drafts)) with another; `hub.Repository.resolve` alone decides
whether the Hub is asked:

- The installed commits: the assembly's links, sizes and times are checked and
  it starts. It is re-assembled first when the draft's repository moved or
  this release changed the GGUF metadata adapter; if the new draft cannot be
  fetched or is not the family's ([Drafts](#drafts)), the installed one is
  kept.
- A new commit: only changed files are downloaded, and the new assembly
  replaces the installed one atomically once published.
- No answer, or a new commit that cannot be installed: the installed model
  starts, with one line naming the Hub's reason or, on stderr, the
  installation attempt that failed.
- A 40-hex `--revision` never moves, nor does its draft, and
  `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` forbids the Hub: both start a verified installation
  without a request.

There is no update flag; to stay on one commit, pass it as `--revision`. A
missing assembly, or one that no longer verifies, is built again. Without the
Hub it is built from a cached snapshot, of the commit the `--revision` names,
or else the one the installation recorded or pinned, or one the Hub cache
records for the branch, never of another revision. Only files downloaded before
are available, which is enough to rebuild a damaged or deleted assembly; a new
selection needs the Hub once for its draft's default branch. The installer
never rewrites upstream files.

### Model storage

Allow space for the target and BF16 draft downloads plus prepared copies of
their weights: up to about 40 GB in total for the Qwen3.8-27B 4-bit examples
and 48 GB for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B. Other variants have different sizes. Downloads
use the Hugging Face cache; prepared weights use `~/Library/Caches/Splash/weights`
(`SPLASH_WEIGHT_CACHE` relocates them). Later starts reuse prepared weights,
and `brew upgrade splash` preserves models and agent sessions.
See [weight preparation](#weight-preparation) for cache validation and cleanup.

### Model cache

To download new models to another disk, set the cache location before serving:

```sh
HF_HUB_CACHE=/Volumes/Models/huggingface splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
```

`HF_HUB_CACHE` selects the Hugging Face download cache. Alternatively, set
`HF_HOME` to relocate the Hugging Face home directory, including its default
`hub` cache. Model links and agent sessions stay in Splash's data directory;
existing downloads are not moved. Prepared weights have their own cache,
which this does not move ([Weight preparation](#weight-preparation)).

### Drafts

Each family names the repository of the DFlash2 checkpoint trained for it
(`Draft` in `families.FAMILIES`), which holds it as the release publishes it:
`config.json` and BF16 `model.safetensors` (or the shards its index names).
Installation downloads only those files and follows the repository's default
branch as it follows the target's ([Revisions](#revisions)); `--draft-model`
accepts another repository, followed the same way, or a local directory that
holds them. A checkpoint is installed only when its configuration states the
family's draft signature (`Draft.signature`), every field and value native
loading requires, so a draft of another architecture never replaces one that
loads. Native loading validates the configuration against the target and
prepares the draft like a target ([Weight preparation](#weight-preparation)):
`DraftCheckpointLoader` (`DraftCheckpoint.cpp`) plans the packed draft files
of a Splash package, `layer-<N>.bin` and `model.bin`, and `AffinePreparation`
quantizes each projection to 4 bits in groups of 64 as MLX's affine
quantization rounds it and copies every other tensor as stored. For both
families the prepared files are byte for byte the Q4 drafts of the Splash
packages.

### Local model directories

`--model-dir DIRECTORY` serves a target already on disk, without a Hub
repository for it. A directory holding an MLX affine 4-bit, group-64 target,
or one GGUF, is inspected by the same adapters as an upstream repository (its
own configuration or GGUF header identifies the family), and installed as an
assembly of links to its own files
([Upstream model loading](#upstream-model-loading)). A directory that is a
Splash runtime package instead verifies its manifest and artifacts and serves
directly from the directory, linked to from the selection
([Legacy Splash packages](#legacy-splash-packages)). The path is recorded
absolute, so the selection does not depend on the working directory, and an
MLX or GGUF target's content is verified on every start: a changed file fails
verification and the assembly is prepared and published again. A directory
with several target GGUFs is ambiguous and refused, listing them; keep one
variant per directory.

A local target has no repository revision to follow and no repository whose
draft Splash may select. A Splash package carries its own DFlash2 draft, so
none is needed; an MLX or GGUF target requires `--draft-model`, which names
the matching DFlash2 checkpoint as a local directory, needing no request, or
as a repository, whose default branch is followed like an upstream draft
([Drafts](#drafts)). `--revision` is rejected, and `--language-only` applies
as it does to an upstream model; a Splash package always serves its vision and
rejects the source options alongside it. The API model ID is derived from the
directory name as `local/<name>`, reduced to the characters a repository ID
allows; `--served-model-name` adds aliases as usual. A Hugging Face cache is
not involved: the files are read where they are. A Splash package is served
from the directory it names, which the selection link points to.

### Tokenizer and chat templates

An MLX target's configuration, tokenizer files and chat template come from its
resolved snapshot. For GGUF, `install/gguf.py` reads the selected file's
metadata without mapping or decoding weight tensors. Vocabulary IDs, BPE merge
ranks, control/user-defined token types, BOS/EOS/padding IDs and template text
come from that file; the supported `gpt2/qwen35` profile supplies the NFC and
byte-level pre-tokenization algorithms. Unknown profiles, malformed metadata
and automatic BOS/EOS insertion are rejected, with no cross-repository
fallback; GGUF sidecar tokenizer/config files do not override embedded metadata.
Model geometry is translated from the same metadata, subtracting any declared
MTP layers from the layer count. Only the header is read before the download.
The tokenizer and configuration are derived from the downloaded file once and
cached under `models/.metadata`, keyed by the size and digest of each source
GGUF, the SHA-256 of `gguf.py` and the `tokenizers` version; publication is
atomic and entries are hash-checked on use.

Request preparation merges the leading system and developer messages into one
system message, joined by a blank line: Responses instructions and developer
items, or an Anthropic `system` and a leading system message. A system message
after that, as agent clients send when they change instructions during a
conversation, renders where it occurs as a system turn in the template's own
markup.

`server/chat_templates.py` probes each of the tokenizer's templates, including
each named variant such as `tool_use`, once at startup, right after the
tokenizer is validated and before the native runtime starts, so a tokenizer
without a template Splash can serve stops startup before any weights load. The
probe renders a canary conversation whose later system message carries a
marker. Startup logs the outcome (`Chat template · ...`), and `/status` reports
it as `chat_template.later_system`:

- `native`: the marker renders in place; the template is used unchanged.
- `patched`: the template rejects the message (the official Qwen templates
  raise) or drops it (Unsloth's Qwen3.6 GGUF template skips it). Jinja's own
  parser finds the construct responsible: the `raise_exception` in the message
  loop's system branch, or the loop condition that excludes system messages.
  The patch renders the message there with the block the template gives a
  leading system message, and is kept only if ordinary conversations (with and
  without tools, every reasoning effort from `none` to `max`, preserved
  thinking, tool calls and results, images), each rendered as requests render
  it, are byte-identical and the canary renders in place.
- `unsupported`: the template renders the message out of place, has no single
  such construct, renders something before its system block (such as a BOS
  token), or its patch failed a probe. A request with a later system message
  fails with a 400 instead of losing it.

Every request, including image placeholder, token-count and judgment
(`/v1/judgments`, `/v1/systemone`) rendering, uses the template chosen at
startup; tokenizer files and the tokenizer object are unchanged. The probe's
upstream fixtures are in `dev/tests/fixtures/chat_templates/`.

### Vision

Vision comes from the target repository: MLX's `vision_tower.*` tensors,
linking only `config.json` and the shards holding them, or the GGUF
repository's root projector, a GGUF whose name holds `mmproj` (as
`mmproj-BF16.gguf` or `MODEL-mmproj-BF16.gguf`), chosen by its header: a `clip`
projector whose weights are BF16, or F32; BF16 is preferred. F16 has a narrower
exponent than BF16, so an F16 projector has already rounded small weights and
is not used. The processor configuration (MLX `preprocessor_config.json`, the
GGUF's `clip.vision` metadata) must describe the one preprocessing Splash
implements (`server/images.py`); it is checked before any weight download and
not installed.

Both sources prepare the packed `vision/model.bin` layout, which the one BF16
vision operator reads: BF16 tensors are copied, and F32 or F16 tensors are
converted under the exact-BF16 rule of [weight preparation](#weight-preparation).
Unsloth's mmproj stores its 1-D tensors, patch embedding and position table as
F32, all of them BF16-exact, and prepares byte-identical to the packed file.
Quantized MLX towers, deepstack projectors and mmproj tensors the tower does not
use are rejected.

`--language-only` links and loads no vision weights and removes them from
memory accounting. It skips a GGUF's mmproj download; MLX vision tensors share
shards with the language model, which download in full. The native Ready event
announces vision only when the model loaded it. Without it, image and PDF input
fails with a 400 naming the modality. Every API shape converts its media to
image and file parts, and message normalization, the one place that accepts or
rejects them, checks before any image is decoded or PDF rendered, in user
turns, tool results and stored Responses history alike. `/status` and
`/v1/models` report `vision: false` and `input_modalities: ["text"]`, and the
launchers configure OpenCode, Hermes and Pi without attachments.

### Weight preparation

Source adapters write a model's target, draft and vision tensors into prepared
files: an MLX target, the DFlash2 draft and any vision tower into the packed
layouts of Splash packages, which run the same kernels, and a GGUF target into
the `MDGG0001` layout of the GGUF kernels. Each adapter is a loader, which
validates the source's metadata and plans its files, and a writer:
`AffineTargetLoader` (`AffineTarget.cpp`) and `AffinePreparation` for an MLX
target, `DraftCheckpointLoader` (`DraftCheckpoint.cpp`) and `AffinePreparation`
for the draft, `GgufTargetLoader` (`GgufTarget.cpp`, planned by `GgufImage.cpp`)
and `GgufPreparation` for a GGUF target, `VisionLoader` and `VisionPreparation`
for an MLX or GGUF vision tower. They open their files through `PreparedFiles`,
the `PreparedWeights` cache with the load's guards. `AffinePreparation` reorders
an MLX target's codes, scales and biases into 256-row tiles without
requantization, quantizes the draft's BF16 projections into the same tiles
([Drafts](#drafts)) and computes GDN decay as `float(-exp(double(A_log)))`,
which may differ by one float ULP in this small vector from packages produced
with MLX's float exponential. `GgufPreparation` repacks GGUF blocks ([GGUF
targets](#gguf-targets)).

Preparation never rounds a target or vision weight, and rounds the draft's
projections only as the packages' drafts are rounded. A tensor it converts to
BF16 (vision tensors stored as F32 or F16, a GGUF's convolution taps and
time-step bias) must be exactly representable in BF16; otherwise preparation
fails, naming the tensor and, for a vision tensor, its file.

The cache is `~/Library/Caches/Splash/weights`, or the directory
`SPLASH_WEIGHT_CACHE` names; nothing else selects it. It holds an additional
copy of the weights about the model's size, its prepared target, draft and
vision tensors. Preparing needs that much free disk space plus a 2 GiB reserve:
before anything is written, the factory (`ModelFactory.cpp`) constructs the
vision tower's loader (`planVisionLoader`, which the vision encoder test
shares), the draft's and the target's, and checks once for the space their
missing files add beyond the entries they supersede (below), plus the largest
file written while the entry it replaces remains, plus the reserve. After a
preparation-identity change, preparing thus needs little more than its largest
file. Uninstalling a model does not delete possibly shared prepared weights.
With Splash stopped, entry directories can be deleted; deleting the whole cache
causes preparation at the next load.

A prepared file's key hashes its adapter's preparation identity, its plan, and
the bytes, type and shape of every source tensor it reads, located and hashed
within its file's tensor data. An edit to a source's metadata only (a GGUF chat
template, a safetensors header), `config.json` or files the component does not
read keeps every key. The preparation identity is a build-generated fingerprint
of only the code that writes the bytes, the files listed per adapter in
`INPUTS` of `dev/tools/weight_preparation_identity.py`; inference, parser,
planner and reader changes keep it. The hashes of the images prepared from the
test fixtures, in `dev/tests/fixtures/weight-goldens/goldens.json`, fail the
tests on any change of prepared bytes. The README beside it gives the
procedure for an intended change: the key the new bytes need, and the order in
which the independent layout oracles and the hashes are updated.

Each entry records in `source` its component (such as `target/layer-0.bin`),
the digest of the source data it was written from and the source path.
Publishing an entry removes the complete entries it supersedes: the same
component from the same source data under another key, which an earlier
preparation identity wrote, and entries of earlier Splash versions prepared from
the same source path. Entries of other sources or revisions, which
installations may share, stay. Removal happens under the converter lock, so no
entry being written is touched, and a running process keeps the files it has
mapped until it unmaps them. Two builds of different preparation identities
sharing one cache supersede each other's entries at every start; give a
development build its own `SPLASH_WEIGHT_CACHE`.

One writer per cache serializes conversion; complete cache hits bypass this
lock. Each output's disk space is preallocated before writing. Interruption,
disk-full errors and memory-pressure rejection cannot publish partial files;
concurrent external disk activity can still exhaust the volume. Retrying removes
abandoned writes under the converter lock and reuses previously completed
files, which are read-only. Cold preparation reports each artifact's progress.

Cold source hashing and output validation stream bounded buffers. Unchanged
files reuse a digest proof tied to device, inode, size, birth time, mtime and
ctime; a write or replacement invalidates it. This is not a full disk scrub on
every startup. Preparation uses uncached destination I/O. Every adapter sizes
its conversion steps to one staging bound, input and output together, of
32 MiB (`kWeightPreparationStagingBytes`), whatever the tensor, layer or expert
count, inside a 64 MiB admission reserve that also covers source metadata.
Complete rows and multiple row tiles are processed together where possible,
avoiding per-row I/O and small GPU waits. Startup runs two checks
(`RuntimeResources.mm`), both stopped by cancellation. `admitWeightPreparation`,
which the loaders receive as `admitConversion`, admits the conversion workspace
on a cache miss, before anything is allocated and again before each chunk: it
requires normal memory pressure and host headroom for the startup reserve plus
the 64 MiB workspace. Cache hits, bounded source verification and every other
Metal operation of startup pass `admitMetalOperation` instead, which critical
pressure or too little headroom for the startup reserve still fails.

`WeightFile` maps completed files, prepared or packed, read-only into one
no-copy Metal buffer, so no model-sized anonymous allocation holds the weights.
It maps a prepared file only if a digest proof covers the very file it opened
and matches the digest its entry records (`requireVerifiedFile`), so a file
replaced or changed after `prepare` checked it is refused.
Runtime admission counts prepared weights, draft and vision exactly once
(`preparedModelWeightBytes`, which `tune-kernels` and the runtime oracle use
too). Before loading, startup refuses a model whose prepared weights, with the
pipeline and runtime reserves, one state cell, one KV extent and any disk tier
KV staging, exceed the hard budget, so a model that can never fit is not
prepared. File backing does not make Metal-resident pages reclaimable, and
`WeightFile` keeps its buffer resident (`MetalBackend::keepResident`): the
weights stay wired between requests until 10 minutes pass without a command,
and the next command wires them again. macOS page cache, driver allocations and
other applications still affect memory pressure and swap.

`loadQwenTarget` (`QwenTargetLoader.hpp`) reads a target's files
(`QwenTargetFiles`: packed files, or the files `AffineTargetLoader` or
`GgufTargetLoader` prepared) through the format that stores them.
`AffineTargetFormat`, for packed and MLX-prepared files, reads every
projection, a fused one too, as one affine Q4 tensor and the norms as bf16.
`BlockTargetFormat`, for prepared GGUF images, reads each GGUF tensor as one
block-quantized `QuantizedSegment` (a fused projection's tensors in output
column order), the norms as F32, and keeps the GDN output projection's input
in llama.cpp's tiled value-head order. Both Qwen families share one layout
(`QwenHybridLayout`) and its validator.

Operator plans use each projection's physical layout, `Affine64` or `Block32`,
independently of the source container. `Projection`, `MoeWeights` and
`EmbeddingWeights` (`runtime/ops/Weights.hpp`, `MoE.hpp`) hold either layout
and represent different operator contracts. Arena sizing collects each
projection's actual layout (a GGUF target's block projections beside its
affine draft's) and reserves the vocabulary head only for decode.

### GGUF targets

`--model unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M` selects the repository's
root-level `.gguf` file (a lower-case extension, as the native loader requires)
for that variant: the file named with the model name its GGUFs share, then
`-UD-Q4_K_M`, or else the only one whose name ends in `-UD-Q4_K_M`
(`upstream.select_gguf`). Before any weight download, its header must list
every tensor the loader reads with a type it accepts for that tensor
(`gguf.loaded_tensors`, checked by `gguf.require_loadable`; a test holds its
quantized types to `runtime/metal/abi/QuantFormat.h`). The native loader checks again
and lists every unsupported tensor in one error:

- linears and experts: Q2_K, Q3_K, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_1,
  IQ1_S, IQ1_M, IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS, IQ2_S, IQ3_XXS, IQ3_S, IQ4_XS, IQ4_NL,
  MXFP4 or PQ2_0;
- token embeddings: Q2_K, Q3_K, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_1 or PQ2_0;
- norms, the MoE router and shared-expert scalar gate, and the GDN
  convolution, decay and time-step bias: F32;
- GDN alpha and beta: both Q8_0, both F32 or both BF16, which preparation
  widens to the F32 values it equals.

Of Unsloth's files in September 2026 that covers every file of Qwen3.8-27B
and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, from UD-IQ1_S up, but UD-Q8_K_XL and BF16, whose BF16
tensors need kernels that do not exist yet. PQ2_0 is Prism ML's type 142,
`block_pq2_0` of PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp, which upstream GGML does not define:
2-bit codes q worth d (q - 1) with one half d per 128 weights. A format's
image takes the bits per weight of its GGUF blocks, but for Q3_K's and Q6_K's
padded meta units (1/16 bit more) and IQ3_S's chunk words (4.06 bits for its
3.44).

Prism ML's GGUFs, such as `prism-ml/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-gguf:PQ2_0`, store
every projection for rotated inputs: the `prism.hadamard.*` metadata names the
tensors whose weights multiply H (D x), H the normalized Walsh-Hadamard
transform of each block of 1024 inputs and D an explicit sign per input, and
the token table, whose rows are stored as H (D e). The engine runs that one
form, on dense targets whose rotation names exactly the tensors the planner
repacks (every quantized projection and the head, and alpha/beta when Q8_0),
a PQ2_0 token table, and GDN value heads in grouped order (the installer
screens the parameters, `GgufFile` and the planner check the rest).
A rotated projection rotates its input once into `LinearScratch::rotated`
(`gguf_rotate`, in fp32 and rounded once to bf16) before its quantized
segments, whose kernels are the format's, while float segments read the input
as it is; the table gathers each row through the inverse (`gguf_embed_rotated_pq20`).

At load time the engine validates the GGUF metadata, including the rotary
embedding and norm epsilon the kernels assume (`rope.freq_base`,
`rope.dimension_count`, `attention.layer_norm_rms_epsilon`, and no
`rope.scaling.type` but `none`), and plans the `MDGG0001` layout.
`GgufPreparation` stages rows in image order on the CPU within the
staging bound, splitting rows wider than it into column chunks, runs the
`gguf_repack` kernel, and writes its planes into a prepared file. Embeddings
and F32 sections use bounded direct copies.

Every tensor keeps its stored format: the F32 norm multipliers, GDN decay, the
MoE router and shared-expert scalar gate, and GDN alpha/beta when a file
stores them as F32 stay F32 and run in fp32, as llama.cpp keeps them (Apple10
prefill chunks multiply the router and alpha/beta on the neural accelerator as
three bf16 parts per weight that sum to it exactly, so only fp32 accumulation
rounds). The GDN convolution and time-step bias become bf16 under the exact
rule.

Decode runs one of two kernel families, chosen by GPU family in `runtime/ops/LinearGguf.cpp`. On
Apple9 (M3, M4) the register tile (`LinearTile::GgufRegister`) runs the kernels of
`runtime/metal/kernels/decode/linear_gguf_sgmatrix.metal`, which feed the codes themselves to
bf16 matrix operations with one fp32 epilogue per coefficient group, so every output is the bf16
rounding of its fp32-accumulated sum. They read their activations as the Table16 table
(`kernels/common/gguf_sgmatrix.h`) that the input's producer writes, or
`decode_linear_gguf_prepare` when none did. The formats whose operands those kernels build from
grid lookups, IQ3_XXS, the IQ2 formats and IQ1 (`apple9StagesFormat`), and Q2_K from two lanes
decode faster on the staged tile there, which a projection all of whose segments are in them
takes wherever the tile holds its lanes' rows unpadded. On Apple10 (M5) the staged tile
(`LinearTile::GgufStaged`) runs the kernels of `runtime/metal/kernels/shared/gguf_linear.metal`,
which dequantize each weight once to half in threadgroup memory (`kernels/common/gguf_staged.h`)
for MPP `matmul2d`, the neural accelerator's path, on bf16 activations; a step of three request
lanes runs the 32-row tile over four lanes of storage. Prefill runs the staged kernels on both
families, chunks of up to 32 rows on the decode tiles. Every projection splits its K across
threadgroups by one rule (`decodeSplits`: each tile's tiers of threadgroups per core and inputs
per partition, from measured occupancy, Apple9's staged tile taking the register tile's) that
does not depend on the batch width. The MoE experts (`runtime/ops/MoE.cpp`) run the same numerics
per family over the grouped rows: the register form in `linear_gguf_sgmatrix.metal`, the staged
one in `kernels/shared/moe_gguf.metal`, which Apple9 takes for experts mostly in the formats it
stages (`MoeShape::expertFormat`). The float router and alpha/beta projections run in
`kernels/shared/gguf_float.metal`, and the token rows are gathered by one template in
`kernels/shared/embedding.metal`. These plans are fixed rules of GPU family, core count, shape and
format: `Linear::setChoices` and `ExecutionPlans::install` reject tuned entries for block
projections and GGUF MoE blocks.

A GGUF kernel of one quantized tensor names its epilogue last: `a` none, `r` residual, `g` the
up pass with the silu gate. The staged ones are `gguf_decode_<format>_m<rows>_<e>` and
`gguf_prefill_<format>_<e>`, the register ones `gguf_decode_sg_<format>_l<lanes>_<e>`, and the
experts `moe_expert_gguf_m<rows>_<e>` and `moe_expert_gguf_sg_<e>`; the fused projections run
`gguf_decode_fused_m<rows>` and `gguf_decode_sg_fused_l<lanes>`. The norm, GDN and
attention-gate variants that also write a register kernel's input table carry `table64` (the
affine Q4 kernel's) or `table16` (the GGUF one's) in their names. The epilogue kinds and SiLU of
both GGUF families are in `kernels/common/gguf_tile.h`, and the MMA helpers every register
kernel uses, affine, GGUF or fp32, in `kernels/common/sgmatrix.h`.

The ABIs are in `runtime/metal/abi/Gguf.h`, which also defines the tile geometry the kernels
and `LinearGguf.cpp` share, and `MoE.h`; the image formats in
`runtime/metal/abi/QuantFormat.h`, their decoding in `runtime/metal/kernels/common/quant_formats.h`
and the decode-only value tables in `runtime/metal/abi/QuantTables.h`, which no prepared byte
depends on; weight preparation's repack ABI is `runtime/metal/abi/GgufRepack.h`. The tables are
llama.cpp's and the decoding follows its Metal kernels: both keep llama.cpp's MIT notice in
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`, which the package ships.

The tests' CPU reference (`dev/tests/engine/GgufFormatReference.hpp`) must reproduce the golden
hashes of upstream GGML's dequantization (llama.cpp 7ab4ee7; for PQ2_0, which upstream lacks,
PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp 01ae597) in `gguf-reference`, and `gguf-planner` checks the planner's
plans; both run in `make test-engine-cpu`.
`make test-engine-metal` runs `gguf-preparation`, which checks every format's planes, as the
production executor and its `gguf_repack` kernel prepare them, bitwise against the reference,
the prepared alpha/beta, norm, convolution and router bytes and the golden images; then
`gguf-dequant`, the staged tile's dequantizer, built with the production Metal flags, against
the half rounding of every reference weight; `gguf-rotation`, `gguf_rotate` and the rotated
PQ2_0 token gather bitwise against the fp32 butterflies and within one bf16 step of fp64;
`gguf-projection`, every GGUF projection through
`ops::Linear` with each tile forced, so both decode tiles run on every GPU, at one to four
lanes, every K split and epilogue, fused segments, every gate/up format pair and the prefill
tiles, each output inside the fp64 bound of `GgufFormatReference.hpp`; and `gguf-moe`: the float
projections on both float tiles and the MoE layer on every GGUF plan, the staged 8- and 32-row
tiles and the Apple9 register tile whatever GPU runs it, in every format, against fp64. The
goldens and how to regenerate them are in `dev/tests/fixtures/weight-goldens/`; with
`SPLASH_GGML_ORACLE=<libggml-base.dylib>`, `gguf-reference` also compares the reference with
GGML directly and prints GGML's hashes.

Two benchmark tools repeat the measurements behind the GGUF split tiers and MoE plans, with the
weights DRAM-cold. `make benchmark-gguf-projection GGUF_PROJECTION_ARGS='q4k 5120 8192'` times one
projection (up to three fused formats and widths, then `K` and an optional epilogue) on both
decode tiles at one to four lanes and every K split, and marks the device policy's pick;
`make benchmark-gguf-moe` times one MoE layer at the 35B shape, GGUF against affine Q4, on the
device's plans and the other GGUF tile.

## Legacy Splash packages

Splash packages, such as `incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash`, are the prebuilt format
that predates upstream loading, and `--model` still accepts them. They contain
`manifest.json`, packed `target/`, `draft/` and `vision/` weights and
`tokenizer/`; the manifest lists artifact paths, sizes and SHA-256 hashes.
Qwen3.8-27B packages use schema 3 / `splash-packed-q4`, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
packages schema 4 / `splash-packed-q4-moe`. Compatible community fine-tunes may
use any nonempty manifest model name. Native loading validates geometry, tensor
sizes, binary headers, tokenizer and target/draft compatibility, and maps the
packed files without preparation. `install/legacy.py` installs a package as a
selection link to its verified Hub snapshot, pinned like an assembly's
sources. An installed package starts without a Hub request. A package has no
variants, so a `:VARIANT` suffix is rejected, and `--revision`,
`--language-only` and `--draft-model` require an upstream model ID.

## Code and API boundaries

- `server/`: OpenAI Chat/Responses, Anthropic Messages/count_tokens, typed
  judgments, templates, streaming and input processing. No client-version branches.
- `runtime/engine/`: scheduling, memory admission and reusable request state.
- `runtime/model/`: target/draft execution and vision.
- `runtime/ops/` and `runtime/metal/`: operators and Metal kernels.
- `install/`: launcher, client configuration and model installation.
- `dev/`: maintained tests, benchmarks and build/release tools.

Within `server/`, `server.py` owns HTTP and startup; `frontend.py` prepares
requests and history; `backend.py` owns native request lifecycles. `judgments.py`
owns finite-choice prompts, validation and typed answer math. `output.py` parses
generated text for both streaming and complete responses, and `constraints.py`
compiles token constraints. `make architecture-check` prevents lower layers from
importing the HTTP entry module.

Tools can be combined with structured answers. Tool argument framing resolves
local references and projects object fields through schema composition. The
original schema validates complete arguments, including cross-field conditions,
dependencies and property-count rules that framing alone cannot enforce; array
item bounds and `multipleOf` above 64 are left to that validation as well, and
the framed schemas of one request are limited to 16 MiB. Extra properties use
JSON-encoded values; statically typed strings retain raw text.
`tool_choice: "none"` renders the tools like any other choice and only
prevents calls. Remote schema references, parameter names containing XML
delimiters and `unevaluatedProperties` combined with `patternProperties` are
unsupported. Hosted search is unsupported; configure client-owned tools such as
MCP. Omitted effort uses the model default.
`response_format` constrains generation and validates final output; it does not
inject formatting instructions into the prompt. Clients should describe their
output requirements in their own messages.
Hidden thinking signatures use a persistent user key; imported encrypted thinking
preserves visible history without recovering the private reasoning.

`/status.admission` distinguishes memory and concurrency waits, reports suspended
requests, recovery draining and the oldest current wait age. Memory transitions
also appear in the console. Warning pressure can pause growth while `/ready`
remains healthy for work that fits existing allocations.

PDF input supports base64 documents within a shared 64 MiB source/rendering
budget and the native 64-image limit (one image per page). Model context and
isolated rendering limits also apply. URL inputs, opening passwords and citations
are unsupported.
Responses automatic truncation and unsupported history edits return errors.

`POST /tokenize` accepts `{"content":"hello","add_special":false}` and returns
`{"tokens":[...]}` using the loaded tokenizer. Special-token strings are recognized;
`parse_special:false` and `with_pieces:true` are unsupported.
`POST /apply-template` accepts Chat-style `messages`, `tools` and reasoning options,
and returns `{"prompt":"..."}` using the same template as generation.
`add_generation_prompt` defaults to true. Image prompts retain textual placeholders;
raw tokenization does not account for image embeddings (use `count_tokens` for that).
Both endpoints run without inference and share bounded preparation capacity with
`count_tokens`; they can inspect prompts larger than the serving context limit.

Streaming requests accept `"return_progress":true` (default false). Before output,
`prompt_progress` reports `{total, cache, processed, time_ms}`: prompt tokens,
initial cached tokens, completed tokens including cache, and elapsed milliseconds
since prefill admission. Updates follow completed chunks and never regress during
recovery; they are not a time estimate. Chat uses empty-delta chunks, Responses
uses `response.in_progress`, and Messages uses `ping`. Queueing and prompt
preparation do not advance this counter. Non-streaming requests cannot enable it.

`GET /status` returns instance identity and the effective context limit as JSON.
Proxy consumers can use these fields; additional fields may be added:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `requests.submitted`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed` | Native request counters since engine start |
| `memory_actual.current_bytes`, `peak_bytes` | Metal allocations, not process RSS |
| `metrics.decode_tokens_per_second` | Aggregate native decode throughput, not a request's end-to-end rate |
| `maximum_context_tokens` | Declared context limit; available memory may limit admission |
| `vision`, `input_modalities` | Whether image and PDF input is accepted; `false` and `["text"]` after `--language-only` |
| `chat_template.later_system` | `native`, `patched` or `unsupported`: how system messages after the first render (per name for named templates) |
| `transport.recovering`, `transport.error` | The engine is restarting; `error` names its failure or the last failed restart |

`GET /metrics` exposes the same counters in Prometheus text format. Both endpoints
require the API key when authentication is enabled. Consumers should tolerate
missing native fields while the engine is unavailable, and counter resets after
an engine restart. Chat streams include token usage when the request sets
`"stream_options":{"include_usage":true}`; non-streaming Chat responses always
include usage. A proxy must consume these fields to display statistics.

Chat completions also include a llama-server-style `timings` object, both in
non-streaming responses and in the final finish-reason chunk of a stream,
even without `include_usage`. `prompt_n` and `predicted_n` are the full prompt
and output counts; `cache_n` is the cached prompt count. `prompt_ms` measures
native start to first emission, and `predicted_ms` measures first emission to
completion. These elapsed intervals exclude the initial admission queue and
are not isolated GPU timings. `prompt_per_second` uses only uncached prompt
tokens; `predicted_per_second` excludes the entire first emission (which can
contain multiple speculative tokens). Thus rates use tokens processed in the
measured interval, not the full counts. An unavailable rate is zero, including
responses completed in one emission. Per-request draft counters are omitted
because the native runtime only reports them at batch level.

`/metrics` also exports fixed latency histograms in seconds, with a bounded
set of stages in `/status.latency`. HTTP duration includes body upload and
response writing for admitted API requests. Preparation, queue, template,
tokenization, output grammar preparation and image preparation are measured
separately; preparation includes its nested stages. Tokenization covers the encoding call, including reuse when
available. Histogram buckets are cumulative and labeled by upper bound.
TTFT starts before upload and ends at the first native token
event. Output intervals are between native token events, which can contain
multiple speculative tokens; they are not per-token latency. Native queue timing
is recorded from successful completions. These histograms live with the HTTP
process and survive a native engine restart.

HTTP bodies require Content-Length, and browser
Origin must match Host. `--allowed-host` permits additional hostnames. Request
logs omit bodies; full crash traces require explicit `SPLASH_CRASH_TRACE=1` and
can contain private conversation data. A frame over 16 MiB, such as a request
with large images, is kept only as a marker with its size and SHA-256
(`omitted_frames` counts them), and a trace missing engine input that way
cannot be replayed.

Requests sharing a cold prefix can wait for a resident request's planned recovery
point, then enter through the ordinary cache restore path. Waiting requests hold
no active state cell or KV pages and return to ordinary admission when no useful
producer remains. Late arrivals can extend the plan at complete state boundaries.
Higher-priority work does not wait for a lower-priority producer. `/status` exposes
`scheduler.waiting_prefix` separately from resource waits.

Greedy and sampled requests can share an unconstrained decode batch; each lane
keeps its own sampling policy and RNG. Pure greedy batches retain their argmax
path. Constrained requests use a separate batch for the host mask exchange.

Long prefill uses disposable rolling checkpoints every 4096 tokens. Contended
prefill adapts toward a 500 ms slice, keeping 2048-token chunks for long unopposed
work. These policies do not extend client deadlines. Memory recovery waits are
bounded: after a suspension, new work waits for resident requests only while
memory is still short, and at most for the 30 s resource wait; suspended
requests then resume first, each within its own resource wait. Readiness does
not guarantee that a request-sized allocation fits.

### Disk cache

`--max-cache-disk` adds an optional SSD tier for cached request states (GDN cell
plus draft ring) and KV pages. Default: `0` (off). RAM and disk copies share the
same block tree and recency order. Restoring a prefix keeps its disk copy, so
its next eviction needs no write while that copy remains cached.

Without the tier, a request that runs out of memory cannot publish its progress
checkpoints and replays its prompt after each suspension. With the tier off,
startup suggests it in one line when memory may not hold the advertised
context: the memory plan within what the host had available at startup beyond
its reserve and the warning margin (`EngineMemoryPlan::contextTokensWithin`).
The estimate is conservative, since macOS compresses other applications further
once the engine loads. The tier does not raise the context limit.

Writes happen when RAM reclamation selects a victim. States copy through one
host staging buffer, freeing their RAM immediately. KV leaves needed by a state
on them or below them copy through a 128-page staging ring and are released
after the write succeeds. Unneeded tails are dropped without writing, together
with any disk copies below them. When staging is busy, admission waits for the
transfer instead of evicting additional victims.
Demotions may occupy half the ring and restores three quarters, leaving room
for the other direction. Copies ride Metal commands, including a copy-only
command when inference is idle.

A state with no available RAM cache slot can be written directly from its lane.
Rolling checkpoints replace the least recently used copies like any state, so
a suspended request keeps its progress when the quota is full; they retire when
replaced or no longer needed. With the disk tier enabled, a checkpoint less than one full
prefill chunk (2048 tokens) before the final replay boundary is captured only
if a RAM slot is available without reclamation. Otherwise its predecessor stays
usable for cancellation recovery; the final reusable state still uses the disk
tier. Matched KV restores start from the root toward the selected
state, with the state read alongside. Cancellation drops unsubmitted, unshared
reads; submitted transfers drain before their buffers can be reused. Restored
states remain usable even when there is no room to promote them into RAM cache.

Two unlinked temporary files share one quota for live slots. A full quota
replaces the oldest redundant copy first, then the oldest sole copy, across
both KV and states. A quota smaller than the working set can cause repeated
reads and writes; it is not a write-rate limit. Each file retains its allocated
high-water mark until shutdown, so filesystem space can exceed the live-slot
quota. Closing the server releases both files.

Transfers use `pread`/`pwrite` with `F_NOCACHE`. The KV staging ring, 128
pages that the GPU copies through, is Metal memory within `--max-memory`: about
42 MiB for 35B and 130 MiB for 27B with INT8 KV, 80 MiB and 256 MiB with BF16 KV.
The memory plan sets it aside whenever the flag is set, even if the tier then
fails to start, so the KV pool and the advertised context shrink by it.
The state staging buffer, one state (109 MiB for 35B, 187 MiB for 27B), is host
memory outside `--max-memory`.
A quota too small for one state leaves the tier disabled.
A failed write disables further writes to that file. Failed KV writes retain
RAM pages; failed state writes invalidate the disk copy. A failed read
invalidates its cached data, allowing lookup to fall back to the surviving
prefix.

`/status` reports the shared quota and KV transfers under `disk`. Its cumulative
`read_bytes` and `written_bytes` count bytes transferred by file IO across KV
and state files, including partial or cancelled transfers. They exclude
filesystem metadata and physical SSD write amplification. State transfers appear
under `state` (`disk_bytes`, `offloads`, `disk_hits`, `disk_promotions`). Cache
counters include:

- `kv_disk_hit_tokens`: tokens restored by completed KV transfers. Shared
  transfers count once, including those completed before cancellation or a
  resource retry.
- `lost_state_misses`: lookups that matched KV where a reusable state used to be.

### Judgment contracts

`POST /v1/systemone` accepts the [TypeSafe System One](https://docs.typesafe.ai/)
request and response shapes: `noul`, `choice` and `score` questions over a shared
state. It works with the official `typesafe-sdk` (verified with 0.7.0). Use the
actual served model ID, not a hosted Jev model name; `/v1/models` answers both
OpenAI model discovery and the SDK's `models.list()`.

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient

with TypeSafeClient(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000",
    api_key="local",  # Use SPLASH_API_KEY's value if server authentication is on.
    model="mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit",
) as client:
    result = client.system_one(
        state={"message": "I was charged twice. Please fix this today."},
        questions={
            "billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?"),
            "department": Choice(
                instructions="Which team should handle this?",
                criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None, "sales": None},
            ),
            "urgency": Score(
                instructions="How urgent is the request?",
                criteria=["No urgency", "This week", "Today"],
            ),
        },
    )
    print(result.choices["department"].choice)
```

`POST /v1/judgments` scores one [SemIf](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf) row of
2–16 options and returns raw option logits:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/judgments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "approval",
    "state": "The proposal is awaiting approval.",
    "question": "What is the current approval status?",
    "options": [
      {"id": "approved", "description": "Approval was explicitly given."},
      {"id": "pending", "description": "Approval has not been given."}
    ]
  }'
```

`POST /v1/judgments` preserves SemIf's `direct-options-v1` JSON serialization,
system prompt and A–P option order. It returns the exact rendered prompt's SHA-256,
answer token IDs, raw option logits, normalized probabilities and zero completion
tokens. Every answer label must round-trip as one token, including at the actual
assistant prompt boundary. Unsupported generation controls return errors rather
than silently changing the scoring protocol. SemIf-derived code retains its MIT
notice in `server/judgments.py`.

`POST /v1/systemone` requires the served `model`, a string/object/array `state`,
and a nonempty `questions` map. Instructions may be omitted, null or structured;
criteria descriptions may also be structured. Noul criteria may be omitted.
Choice and score domains contain 1–255 entries. Singletons return their sole
answer without inference. Other domains use deterministic, distinct single-token
slots selected from the tokenizer. All questions are validated before any inference.
A request holds at most 64 questions and 1M total prepared prompt tokens;
larger batches are rejected before any inference.
Questions run sequentially within a request under one shared deadline, allowing
prefix reuse without filling the admission queue; independent HTTP requests still
share the scheduler. Disconnects and timeouts cancel the current question.

Preparation renders each prompt once, then enforces the context limit and the
batch token budget before the per-slot boundary checks, which re-tokenize the
prompt once per option. Those checks also observe the request deadline, so an
oversized or expired request is rejected without paying for every option.
Prompts that exceed the context limit are rejected, not truncated.

System One validation uses 422 `detail` arrays; successful responses contain
`model`, `answers`, and `usage`, plus an `x-typesafe-request-id` header. SDK model
discovery reports an empty `release_date` because Splash records none for a model.
The official SDK is a client only, not a server dependency. API compatibility does
not imply Jev weights, accuracy, proprietary confidence semantics or calibration.

These are local model scores, not calibrated confidence. Probabilities are a
softmax over the declared answer slots. Choice/score `confidence` is normalized
entropy concentration, `1 - H(p) / log(K)`, not an estimate of correctness.
Score answers are probability-weighted level indices. Measure accuracy and
calibrate on representative held-out data before using decision thresholds.

Native wire version 6 appends score-token IDs to requests and selected f32 logits
to Done events; a version mismatch is fatal. Scoring requires 2–255 distinct,
in-vocabulary tokens, no images or generation constraints, and a zero output budget.
It may use the full context window because no generated token needs a reserved
position. The final prefill chunk runs the target head but no sampling policy or
DFlash decode. Successful scoring emits no Tokens event, finishes with Stop, and
reports zero decode time. Cancelled requests carry no logits.

A non-finite score logit is a per-request failure, not an engine fault: the
engine reports `model_result_invalid` for that request alone, before it
publishes the failing step's cache state or any output, and the rest of the
batch finishes normally. Prompt chunks that already succeeded keep the blocks
they committed, exactly as they do for a cancelled request. GPU faults and
broken engine invariants stay fatal and still mark the runtime unhealthy.

## Validate

```sh
make check
make install test-real test-http-real MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
```

`make check` needs no model weights. `make check-native-cpu` builds production
and runs native CPU tests without a GPU; `make check-native-metal` requires a
supported Metal device and runs the kernel tests under shader validation, and the Linear pipeline
resource check without it. They
include the preparation of small synthetic MLX, GGUF and vision sources and the
GGUF kernels on synthetic tensors. Hosted CI runs CPU checks and sanitizers.

The real-model targets take `MODEL` exactly as `splash serve --model` does,
and `REVISION`, `DRAFT_MODEL` and `LANGUAGE_ONLY=1` as its `--revision`,
`--draft-model` and `--language-only`, and run the installation
`make install MODEL=...` with the same options prepared in this checkout's
`install/models`:

| Target | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| `verify-models` | the installer's restarts without the Hub, `verify --full`, and the prepared-weight record (`dev/tools/installer_restarts.py`, [Release check](#release-check)) |
| `test-real` | vision parity with the family's fixture in `dev/tests/fixtures/vision-parity/` when the installation serves vision, and the native model runtime oracle |
| `test-http-real` | the HTTP frontend on an isolated server (`dev/tests/smoke_real.py`) |
| `test-agent-real` | the five official clients through `splash serve` (`dev/tests/agent_real.py`), in `AGENT_SCENARIO` `complete` (the default) or `smoke` |
| `test-release-real` | the HTTP smoke and all five clients on one `splash serve` |
| `test-performance-real` | the native decode and partial-prefix benchmark, or with `BASELINE` its ABBA comparison with that build (`dev/benchmarks/backend_regression.py`) |
| `release-check` | one model on this Mac ([Release check](#release-check)) |

`benchmark-backend`, `benchmark-decode-profile` and `tune-kernels` take `MODEL`
the same way. The models they are run with, one per family and source format:

| Family | MLX | GGUF | Splash package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3.8-27B | `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit` | `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M` | `incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash` |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit` | `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M` | `incoai/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Splash` |

The source formats load differently: an MLX target is prepared into the packed
layout, a GGUF target into its own layout for the GGUF projection and MoE
kernels, and a package's packed files are mapped as they are.

`make test-engine-cpu` builds the affine source oracle so it cannot break
unnoticed, but no target runs it because it needs real models: after
`make all build/engine-tests/affine-source-oracle`, pass it
`build/splash.metallib`, an installed MLX model's `target` directory and the
matching installed package to compare every prepared byte.

Compare performance on the same idle Mac with the same model and workload.
`make tune-kernels MODEL=...` measures the precompiled kernel candidates for the
installed model on this Mac against the policy defaults in `runtime/ops` and
prints, per key, the winner with its paired GPU and wall-time gain, spelled as
the enumerators it would install, or that the default is kept; it changes no
default and saves no profile. For a GGUF model
it measures only the attention kernels and the draft, and says so in its
header, since GGUF projection and MoE plans read no tuned choice
([GGUF targets](#gguf-targets)). Keep generated reports, profiles, local paths
and experiment notes out of the source tree and commits.

### Release check

A release is checked once per source identity, and then on each Apple GPU
family (an Apple9 M3 and an Apple10 M5) against a retained baseline build,
`BASELINE`: a checkout whose `build/` holds `splash`, `splash.metallib` and
`engine-tests/backend-benchmark`. `release-check` fails without it. The
baseline must load the model: it is the previous release's build when that
loads the model. Splash 1.0.x loads only Splash packages, so for 1.1, the
first release that loads upstream models, an upstream model's baseline is a
build of the last commit before the change under test; the legacy package can
always be compared with 1.0.2. From a clean checkout:

```sh
make check test-sanitizers                      # once, model-free
make check-native-metal                         # once on each Mac
make install release-check MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit REVISION=<commit> BASELINE=../splash-baseline
make install release-check MODEL=unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M LANGUAGE_ONLY=1 REVISION=<commit> BASELINE=...
make install release-check MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit REVISION=<commit> BASELINE=...
make install release-check MODEL=unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M REVISION=<commit> BASELINE=...
make install release-check MODEL=incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash BASELINE=../splash-1.0.2
make install verify-models MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit
make test-agent-real MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit REVISION=<commit> AGENT_SCENARIO=smoke AGENT_CLIENTS=...
```

Pin each upstream model to one commit, the same on both Macs. Without a Hub
token for a private draft repository, set `DRAFT_MODEL` to a local copy of the
draft's checkpoint ([Drafts](#drafts)). The Metal suite depends on the GPU
family, so it runs once on each Mac. Per model, `release-check`:

- runs the runtime oracle and, when the installation serves vision, vision
  parity (`test-real`);
- restarts the installer offline, with the Hub unreachable
  (`HF_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:9`) and with an empty `HF_HUB_CACHE`: each
  restart must start the same assembly within 10 seconds, name the Hub's
  reason on one line when it asked the Hub ([Revisions](#revisions)), and
  download nothing. It then hashes the sources and records in
  `prepared.json` the component and SHA-256 of every prepared-weight entry
  the installation loads (`verify-models`; a legacy package is only hashed);
- runs the HTTP smoke, which for a text-only installation checks the 400s
  instead of images (`test-http-real`);
- compares this build with `BASELINE`, which must have another build
  identity, in ABBA order (`test-performance-real`): output tokens and
  acceptance must be identical (`EXPECT_OUTPUT_CHANGE=1` allows changed
  outputs with acceptance within 0.02), and so must the prepared bytes,
  which a baseline of another preparation identity prepares into a cache of
  its own; decode and prefill GPU time may regress by at most the larger of
  2% and twice the run's own ABBA spread, and a spread above 5% fails as
  inconclusive.

Results go to `build/release/<owner>--<repo>[--VARIANT]/`. Preparation does not
depend on the GPU, so each model's `prepared.json` must be identical on the
two Macs. The unpinned `verify-models`, run after the pinned ones while the
default branch still names the pinned commit, resolves the branch online, and
its unreachable-Hub restart must fall back with the Hub's reason. The agent
clients depend on neither the model's format nor the GPU: run the smoke
scenario once per Mac, with the five clients split between the Macs, and
`AGENT_SCENARIO=complete` for one model when the client integration changed.
Expect about 1.5 hours on an M5 Pro and 2.5 hours on an M3 Max, most of it in
the three 27B comparisons. A laptop can cap its GPU power during a long
comparison and so make it inconclusive; rerun `make test-performance-real` for
that model alone once the Mac has cooled.

### Local benchmarks

From a source checkout with the model installed, use the native benchmark for
prefill, decode and batch measurements:

```sh
make test-performance-real MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
make test-performance-real MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit BASELINE=/path/to/baseline
```

The first characterizes this build: the decode widths B1-B4 and a 14,096-token
partial-prefix request, three samples each, in
`build/release/<owner>--<repo>[--VARIANT]/backend-benchmark.json`;
`make benchmark-backend MODEL=...` adds the 2K to 128K contexts. The second
compares this build with a retained checkout's in ABBA order, as the release
check does ([Release check](#release-check)), and writes
`backend-regression.json` there. Neither is a comparison with another engine
or a test of agent task quality.

For a same-machine HTTP regression check, retain the previous `splash` binary
**and its adjacent `splash.metallib`**, then run from the candidate checkout:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m dev.benchmarks.http_regression \
  --model unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M \
  --baseline-binary /path/to/baseline/build/splash \
  --contexts 2048,10000 --samples 5
```

It takes any installed model and, for an upstream one, holds its assembly for
the whole run, so every round serves the same model. It starts isolated servers
in ABBA order, compares matched cold, exact-prefix and decode requests by the
release check's speed rule and prepared bytes, and saves
`build/release/http-regression.json`.
It does not contact your running server. Use the same power mode and charger,
stop other GPU workloads, and report chip/GPU cores, memory, Splash version,
model revision, actual input/output token counts, and cache hits with results.
Keep cold prefill, cached TTFT and sustained decode separate; a UI token rate
alone does not measure end-to-end agent performance.

For slow tool-bearing requests, the `latency` section of `/status` separates
preparation, tokenization, grammar preparation, native queueing and TTFT. Grammar preparation
includes construction, compilation/cache lookup and per-request cloning;
it does not include generation-time masks. The `grammar_cache` counters show
whether compiled output grammars are reused. Tool definitions still contribute
tokens to the prompt; saving their JSON alone cannot avoid model prefill.
Existing exact-prefix caching reuses model work while the server remains alive.
Text requests also reuse tokenized history at literal message-end boundaries
when the tokenizer supports independent encoding there. This process-local
cache retains at most four prefixes and 8 MiB of text/token storage; it falls
back to full encoding for other tokenizer pipelines. `/status.tokenizer_cache`
reports its usage. It does not alter prompt text, token IDs or the GPU KV cache.
Server restarts require recomputation. The SSD tier (`--max-cache-disk`, see
[disk cache](#disk-cache)) keeps evicted KV pages and states during a server
session; its temporary files do not survive shutdown.

## Package

Release archives contain no Hugging Face credentials and use the official model
list committed with the source. The model-catalog workflow updates that list
from the official collection independently of packaging.
Users accessing private models supply their own `HF_TOKEN` or Hugging Face login.

Release versions are three-part, `x.y.z`, with no `v` prefix: `1.0.0`, then
`1.0.1` for a fix and `1.1.0` for a feature. Use the same version in all three
commands:

```sh
make package RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
make package-bottle RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
make package-check RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
```

The archive, checksum, formula and bottle go to `dist/`; these commands do not
publish. Build bottles on the oldest supported macOS. Bottle/check commands use
a temporary tap and remove their installation; they refuse to replace an existing
Splash installation. The install check requires a poured bottle and runs the
bundled launcher without a compiler or separate Python installation.

### macOS app and disk image

`make package-dmg` packages a self-contained `Splash-<version>.dmg`: the
native SwiftUI control panel (`macos/`) with the runtime archive embedded
under `Contents/Resources/runtime`, so installing the app needs no other
download and neither does first run (only the chosen model does):

```sh
make package RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
make package-dmg RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0     # needs the archive above
```

The app owns no model or engine code: it locates the embedded runtime,
launches `install/launcher.py serve`, shows its log and a live panel of
`/status` metrics (decode/prefill rates, request counts, Metal memory, caches
and admission waits), and keeps a menu bar item to start and stop it. The
conversation is the server's own web page: a conspicuous button opens
`chat.html` in the browser, and the main window holds no chat. Its labels and
the chat page follow the system interface language (English and Simplified
Chinese are bundled). The model
section offers three modes — a Splash package (its draft is built in), an
upstream MLX or GGUF model (the installer pairs its draft), or a local
directory per [local model directories](#local-model-directories) — and the
server section exposes port, memory, context, KV format, text-only, an API
key, model aliases, an SSD cache quota, request-size and default reasoning
effort. The bundle is built with Xcode's Swift toolchain, the placeholder icon
is generated at package time, and neither the app nor the DMG is code-signed:
it is for local installation, and distributing it requires signing and
notarization. `make package-app` builds just `dist/Splash.app` (no DMG), and
`RUNTIME_DIR=<directory>` overrides the archive with a staged runtime
directory, for a source checkout without one. `SOURCE_OVERLAY=1` embeds this
checkout's `install/` and `server/` instead of the archive's, so a published
engine serves the working tree's installer and server code without a local
rebuild.

To publish, tag the verified release commit in `incoai/splash` with the
version (no `v` prefix), preserving existing history and tags. Create a GitHub
Release with the runtime archive, bottle, checksum files and `SHA256SUMS`.
Open a pull request in `incoai/homebrew-tap` replacing `Formula/splash.rb`
with `dist/splash.rb`; its URLs must point to the published release assets.
After the tap update merges, verify a fresh install and an upgrade from the
previous release through the public tap, including a real model request and
preservation of user data. Run `brew audit --strict --online incoai/tap/splash`.

Before publishing, verify that default model and draft repositories are
publicly accessible. Check the installed bottle on a supported Mac without
developer tools; building from the source tree is not an installation check.

The runtime package allowlists engine, Python, server and launcher files; tests,
benchmarks and developer documents are excluded. User model links and Hermes
sessions survive upgrades; downloads remain in the Hugging Face cache.
